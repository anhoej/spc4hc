The control limits are given by: \\[\\bar{p}\\pm3\\sigma_{pi}\\sigma_z\\] where \\(\\sigma_z\\) represents the between-subgroup variation, calculated using the moving range of the standardized values \\(z_i\\), defined as: \\[z_i=(p_i - \\bar{p})/\\sigma_{pi}\\] The moving range is: \\[MR_i=|z_i-z_{i-1}|\\] Then, the estimate of between-subgroup variation \\(\\sigma_z\\) is: \\[\\sigma_z=\\overline{MR_z}/1.128\\] Thus, the final control limits for the P′ chart are: \\[\\bar{p}\\pm3\\sigma_{pi}\\sigma_z \\] 14.2 U’ charts Similarly, control limits for the U’ chart are calculated as: \\[\\bar{u}\\pm3\\sigma_{ui}\\sigma_{z}\\] where \\(\\sigma_{ui}\\) is the within subgroup variation: \\[\\sigma_{ui}=\\sqrt{(u_i/n_i)}\\] and \\(\\sigma_{z}\\) is the between subgroup variation based on the average moving range of z-scores defined: \\[MR_i=|z_i-z_{i-1}|\\] where \\[z_i=(u_i-\\bar{u})/n_i\\] Then the between subgroup variation \\(\\sigma_{z}\\) is: \\[\\sigma_{z}=\\overline{MR}/1.128\\] and the control limits are: \\[\\bar{p}\\pm3\\sigma_{pi}\\sigma_z \\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
