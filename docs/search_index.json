It is useful in many situations and can frequently serve as a valid – or even superior – alternative to other Shewhart SPC charts. This is partly because the I chart is based on the actual observable variation in data, rather than on theoretical distributional assumptions, which may or may not be true. However, the I chart does not account for variable subgroup sizes – that is, when the area of opportunity varies between samples, such as when the number of patients fluctuates from month to month. When the variation is small, this may not pose a problem, but often – particularly in healthcare – size matters. Several solutions have been proposed. Here we present the normalised I chart or – as we prefer to name it – the I' (pronounced I prime) chart suggested by Taylor (2018). References Taylor, Wayne. 2018.
