Juran as a tool to identify the most important causes of a problem. For this example, we use the dataset on adverse events causing harm to patients, collected using the Global Trigger Tool method (Plessen, Kodal, and Anhøj 2012). # print structure of ae data str(ae) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 131 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ severity: chr &quot;E&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;F&quot; ... ## $ category: chr &quot;Pressure ulcer&quot; &quot;Gastrointestinal&quot; &quot;Infection&quot; &quot;Infection&quot; ... The paretochart() function (from qicharts2) takes a categorical vector as argument and plots a Pareto chart as demonstrated in Figure 18.1. paretochart(ae$category) Figure 18.1: Pareto chart of patient harm. The bars show the count in each category, and the curve shows the cumulated percentage over categories. Almost 80% of harms come from 3 categories: gastrointestinal, infection, and procedure. Figure 18.2 is a Pareto chart of harm severity demonstrating that nearly all events resulted in temporary harm (E-F). paretochart(ae$severity) Figure 18.2: Pareto chart of harm severity: E-I, where E-F = temporary harm, G-H = permanent harm, and I = fatal harm. The paretochart() function takes a character or factor vector, but often data have already been aggregated into tabular format: ae.tbl category count 1 Fall 1 2 Gastrointestinal 40 3 Infection 34 4 Medication 18 5 Other 4 6 Pressure ulcer 5 7 Procedure 29 To make a Pareto chart from tabular data, we first need to convert data back into a vector. This can be achieved with the rep() function repeating each category by its count: # make vector from counts ae.cat &lt;- rep(ae.tbl$category, ae.tbl$count) # show first six rows of vector head(ae.cat) ## [1] Fall Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal ## [5] Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal ## 7 Levels: Fall Gastrointestinal Infection Medication Other ... Procedure # plot Pareto chart paretochart(ae.cat) In conclusion, the Pareto chart is useful for identifying the most common causes of a problem. Often most of the problems are caused by relatively few of the causes. In the example above eliminating gastrointestinal harm (most often obstipation) and hospital associated infections would more than half the rate of adverse events.
