Juran as a tool to identify the most important causes of a problem. For this example, we use the dataset on adverse events causing harm to patients, collected during a number of Global Trigger Tool reviews (Plessen, Kodal, and Anhøj 2012). # print structure of ae data str(ae) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 131 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ severity: chr &quot;E&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;F&quot; ... ## $ category: chr &quot;Pressure ulcer&quot; &quot;Gastrointestinal&quot; &quot;Infection&quot; &quot;Infection&quot; ... The paretochart() function (from qicharts2) takes a categorical vector as argument and plots a Pareto chart as demonstrated in Figure 18.1. paretochart(ae$category) Figure 18.1: Pareto chart of patient harm. The bars show the number in each category, and the curve shows the cumulated percentage over categories. Almost 80% of harms come from 3 categories: gastrointestinal, infection, and procedure. Figure 18.2 is a Pareto chart of harm severity demonstrating that nearly all events resulted in temporary harm (E-F). paretochart(ae$severity) Figure 18.2: Pareto chart of harm severity: E-I, where E-F = temporary harm, G-H = permanent harm, and I = fatal harm. ae.tbl category count 1 Fall 1 2 Gastrointestinal 40 3 Infection 34 4 Medication 18 5 Other 4 6 Pressure ulcer 5 7 Procedure 29 ae.cat &lt;- rep(ae.tbl$category, ae.tbl$count) head(ae.cat) ## [1] Fall Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal ## [5] Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal ## 7 Levels: Fall Gastrointestinal Infection Medication Other ...
