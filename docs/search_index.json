While SPC is often thought of simply as a set of tools – the control chart being its most prominent member – we prefer to think of SPC more broadly as the application of statistical thinking to continuous quality improvement. Statistical Process Control is not about statistics, it is not about “process-hyphen-control”, and it is not about conformance to specifications. […] It is about the continual improvement of processes and outcomes. And it is, first and foremost, a way of thinking with some tools attached. — Don Wheeler (Wheeler 2000, p 152) Many excellent books have been written about the thinking and the theory behind SPC (e.g. Wheeler 2000; Montgomery 2009; Mohammed 2024), but very little has been written about how to actually construct SPC charts – especially using software. Consequently, this book is mostly about the tools, in particular run and control charts, and how to construct and interpret them using modern software. For example, a control chart like the one in Figure (0.1) may be produced using a single line of code in R (R Core Team 2024), which is often referred to as the lingua franca of statistical computing and visualisation. And since SPC is all about statistical computing and visualisation, R is our software of choice. Figure 0.1: I control chart produced with the R package qicharts2 SPC charts are powerful, intuitive and versatile. First developed in the 1920’s in production industry, the use of SPC in healthcare has grown spectacularly. For instance, the number of papers in the pubmed database went from only 14 in 1971 to 3252 in 2023 [SEARCH CRITERIA?]. However, a review of SPC in healthcare noted that “it’s easy and not so easy” [CITATION]. The “easy part” is that SPC charts are usually intuitive and easily understood. The “not so easy part” involves the production of these charts. This book aims to help people who want to produce SPC charts in practice using modern software. We refer to such people as data scientist whilst recognising that they may be analysts, practitioners, managers, teachers, students, researchers, patients, etc. So what is different about this book? This book stands out by being a specialized, practical, and modern guide specifically tailored for data scientists in the healthcare sector. Its focus on real-world application, combined with comprehensive coverage of SPC techniques and the use of contemporary tools, makes it a unique and valuable resource. This book is a how to book. Target Audience: This book is specifically tailored for data scientists who want to learn how to produce SPC charts by the R programming language. Use of R: Our choice of software is R - which is popular, free, and open source. One major advantage of R (and programming languages in general) is that all the steps and procedures involved in analysing data and constructing graphs and other output are documented in readable form in the source code thus making analyses transparent and reproducible, which is rarely the case with “point-and-click” software. Another advantage is that R has built-in functions for producing publication ready graphics of very high quality. By being pro-R we are not anti any other software, and the principles involved in creating SPC chart with R demonstrated in this book may be ported to other software solutions. Healthcare Focus: While there are many general books on SPC, this book’s focus is on practical applications in healthcare, making it particularly relevant for those working in this field. It addresses the unique challenges and requirements of applying SPC methods in healthcare settings, such as patient safety, clinical outcomes, and operational efficiency as described in an accompanying book (Mohammed 2024). Practical Guide: The book is a practical step-by-step guide, using real-world examples and case studies that enable readers to produce and use SPC charts with confidence. This hands-on approach helps bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comprehensive Coverage: The book covers a comprehensive range of topics within SPC, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. This ensures that both beginners and experienced data scientists can find valuable insights and techniques that can be applied to their work in healthcare. Resources: The book comes with additional resources such as R scripts, datasets, and access to an online GitHub repository. Prerequisites: We assume no prior knowledge of SPC, but a basic familiarity with R is required to understand the processes and algorithms for constructing SPC charts. Mathematical details are relegated to appendices. We hope you find the book useful and would appreciate your feedback on how it can be continually improved upon.

In this chapter we will start constructing SPC chart. We begin using only functions from base R. Later we will move to ggplot2and qicharts2. In essence, an SPC charts is a (point-and-)line plot of data over time with a horizontal line to represent the data centre and – in case of a control chart – two lines to represent the estimated upper and lower bounds of the natural variation in data. To construct an SPC chart, all we need are four vectors with the y-coordinates of the data points and lines. Let’s start by creating some artificial data to work with. We draw 24 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation (sd) = 1. # Initialise random number generator to make results reproducible set.seed(27) # Create a vector of 24 random numbers from a normal distribution y &lt;- rnorm(24, mean = 0, sd = 1) 2.1 A run chart from random normal data First we plot a simple run chart without any helper lines (Figure 2.1): # Make point-and-line plot plot(y, type = &#39;o&#39;) Figure 2.1: Simple run chart (As a side note, this reminds me (JA) of a manager, who once said to me: “You make such beautiful graphs, but can’t you stop them from going up and down all the time.” 😁) Then we add the the centre line to the plot. Since we know the parameters of the distribution data come from, we can use the theoretical population mean/median (= 0) as the centre line. With the centre line in place, we can apply runs analysis to identify unnatural patterns suggesting sustained shifts or trends in data over time (Figure 2.2): # Create y-coordinates for the centre line cl &lt;- rep(0, length(y)) # Plot data and add centre line plot(y, type = &#39;o&#39;) lines(cl) Figure 2.2: Run chart with centre line We find that the longest runs (there are two of them, 6:10 and 15:19) have 5 data points and that the curve crosses the centre line 9 times. With 24 data points and using the runs rules proposed previously, the upper limit for longest run is 8 as is (coincidentally) the lower limit for number of crossings. Consequently, these data seem to come from a random process (which we already knew). 2.2 Adding control limits to produce a control chart We use the same technique to add the lower and upper control limits. Remember that the control limits are usually set to \\(CL \\pm 3 SD\\), where CL is the centre line and SD is the estimated standard deviation – that is, the standard deviation of the natural variation in data, not the pooled standard deviation that would include both random and any non-random variation. Again, since we know the parameters of the distribution, we use the theoretical population standard deviation (= 1) to calculate the control limits. # Create y-coordinates for the control limits lcl &lt;- rep(-3, length(y)) ucl &lt;- rep(3, length(y)) Finally, we need to expand the y-axis limits to make room not only for the data points but also the lines (Figure 2.3): # Plot data expanding y-axis to make room for all data and lines plot(y, type = &#39;o&#39;, ylim = range(y, lcl, ucl)) # Add lines lines(ucl) lines(cl) lines(lcl) Figure 2.3: Standardised control chart As expected, all data points fall within the control limits suggesting only random variation. Now, let’s mimic a shift in data by introducing four data points (21:24) from a normal distribution with mean = 3 (Figure 2.4): # Initialise random number generator to make results reproducible set.seed(19) # Introduce a shift in data y[21:24] &lt;- rnorm(4, mean = 3) # Plot control chart plot(y, type = &#39;o&#39;, ylim = range(y, lcl, ucl)) lines(ucl) lines(cl) lines(lcl) Figure 2.4: Control chart with data points outside the upper control limit (freaks) Note that only one of the four data points from the shift is above the upper control limit. This is a reminder that even large shifts in data are not guaranteed to show up immediately. Rather, shifts in data increases the chance that future data point will fall outside the limits. The chance of discovering a shift depends on two things: 1. the size of the shift; 2. how long we are willing to wait for a shift to show itself. 2.3 That’s all, Folks! So constructing an SPC chart using R may be done using only a few lines of code. In fact, most of the code in this chapter went to prepare the data to be plotted. The charts themselves are rather simple and plotting is the same every time: 1. plot the dots; 2. add the lines. Later we will wrap all the steps in a function that also automates the calculation of empirical centre and control lines, highlights signals of non-random variation in data, and makes plots that are a lot nicer to look at than the rather crude ones we have produces so far. In the next chapter we will calculate control limits for the control charts that are most commonly used in healthcare, “The Magnificent Seven”. This is all about estimating the standard deviation in data, which depends on the type of data.
