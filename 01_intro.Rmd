# Preface {-#preface}

This book is about the practical application of statistical process control (SPC) methodology in healthcare.

SPC is based on a fundamental intuitive insight -- that processes are subject to two sources of variation: common cause and special cause variation. This simple yet profound insight enables us to monitor, understand, and improve a wide range of processes.

With this insight comes a set of intuitive visual tools, run and control charts, that make it easy to tell common from special cause variation.

Nevertheless a systematic review concluded 

>... although SPC charts may be easy to use even for patients, clinicians or managers without extensive SPC training, they may not be equally simple to *construct correctly*. To apply SPC is, paradoxically, both simple and difficult at the same time.

Consequently, this book aims to ease the construction and production of SPC charts in healthcare using modern software.

## So what is different about this book? {-}

This book is a *how to easily produce SPC charts book*. Since this involves statistics, computing, and visualisation our software of choice is R -- which is often referred to as the *lingua franca* of statistical computing and visualisation. 

This book stands out by being a *specialized*, *practical*, and *modern* guide specifically tailored for data scientists in the healthcare sector. Its focus on real-world application, combined with comprehensive coverage of SPC techniques and the use of contemporary tools, makes it a unique and valuable resource. 

1. **Target Audience**:  This book aims to help people who want to produce SPC charts in practice using modern software. This book is specifically tailored for data scientists who want to learn how to produce SPC charts using the R programming language. We refer to such people as data scientist whilst recognising that they may be analysts, practitioners, managers, teachers, students, researchers, clinicians or patients.

2. **Use of R**: Our choice of software is R, which is popular, free, and open source. By being pro-R we are not anti any other software. Indeed we encourage readers to use this book with their preferred software and share it with the world. One major advantage of R (and programming languages in general) is that all the steps and procedures involved in analysing data and constructing graphs and other output are documented in readable form in the source code thus making analyses transparent and reproducible, which is rarely the case with "point-and-click" software. Another advantage of R is that it enables the automation of repeated tasks such as monthly reports, slide decks and dashboards of SPC charts with high quality customisable graphics.

3. **Healthcare Focus**: While there are many general books on SPC, this book's focus is on practical applications in healthcare, making it particularly relevant for those working in this field. It addresses the unique challenges and requirements of applying SPC methods in healthcare settings, such as patient safety, clinical outcomes, and operational efficiency as described in an accompanying book [@mohammed2024].

4. **Practical Guide**: The book is a practical step-by-step guide,  using real-world examples and case studies that enable readers to produce and use SPC charts with confidence. This hands-on approach helps bridge the gap between theory and practice.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The book covers a comprehensive range of topics within SPC, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. This ensures that both beginners and experienced data scientists can find valuable insights and techniques that can be applied to their work in healthcare.

6. **Resources**: The book comes with additional resources such as R scripts, datasets, and access to an online [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anhoej/spc4hc).

## Prerequisites {-}

We assume no prior knowledge of SPC, but a basic familiarity with R is required to understand the steps and algorithms for constructing SPC charts. For readers not familiar with R we refer you to some excellent (free) resources for getting started with R including the amazing [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/).

## How to use this book {-}

If you are new to SPC, then start with Chapter \@ref(variation). If you are eager to get started with plotting then skip to chapters \@ref(first-chart) and \@ref(limits). Later chapters move to more advanced types of charts and topics for newbies and knowbies. Further resources and datasets can be found on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anhoej/spc4hc).

We hope you find the book of some use and would appreciate your feedback on how it can be continually improved.
