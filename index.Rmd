# {-}

This is the online version of *Mastering statistical process control charts*, a book currently under early development.

>Statistical Process Control is not about statistics, it is not about "process-hyphen-control", and it is not about conformance to specifications. [...] It is about the continual improvement of processes and outcomes. And it is, first and foremost, *a way of thinking* with some tools attached.
