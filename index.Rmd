INTRODUCTION  
&emsp; What is SPC?  
&emsp; About the Book

PART 1: Understanding Variation

1. Understanding Variation
    1. Given two numbers, one will be bigger
        1. rolling dies and flipping coins
        1. when you throw a die and get a seven
    1. Populations and processes (enumerative vs analytical studies)
    1. Patterns of non-random variation in time series data and their interpretation
        1. freaks
        1. shifts
        1. trends
        1. waves
        1. sawtooths(teeth?)
        1. repeated patterns
1. What is SPC?
    1. History
    1. A modern definition
    1. SPC and continuous quality improvement -- neither can live while the other dies
    1. The Case for SPC in Healthcare  
1. Introducing SPC Charts
    1. Anatomy of SPC charts
    1. What SPC charts do and don't do
1. Testing for Non-random Variation in SPC Charts
    1. Tests based on sigma limits
        1. the 3-sigma test
        1. the Western Electric rules
    1. Runs analysis -- tests based on the distribution of data points around the centre line
        1. identifying unusually long runs
        1. identifying unusually few crossings
        1. look mom, no control limits! -- using runs analysis as stand-alone rules with run charts
    1. Rules to avoid
        1. the trend rule
        1. too short longest runs
1. Responding to SPC Signals
    1. The voice of the customer vs the voice of the process
    1. Conciliating the two voices -- or, from RAGs to RICHes  
        (RAG = Red, Amber, Green; RICH = Respond, Investigate, Celebrate'n Hold)

PART 2: Constructing SPC Charts with R

1. Your First SPC Charts with Base R
    1. A run chart from random normal data

    1. S chart
    1. I chart (aka X chart)
    1. MR chart
    1. C chart
    1. U chart
    1. P chart
1. Highlighting Data Points Outside Control Limits (freaks)
1. Highlighting Shifts, Trends, and Waves Found by Runs Analysis
1. One R Function to Rule Them All
1. Your First SPC Chart with `ggplot2`
1. Introducing `qicharts2` -- an R Package Tailored Specifically for SPC in Healthcare
