- GitHub

PART 1: Understanding Variation

1. What is SPC?
    1. History
    1. A modern definition
    1. SPC and continuous quality improvement -- neither can live while the other dies
    1. The case for SPC in healthcare
1. Understanding Variation
    1. Given two numbers, one will be bigger
        - different numbers may come from the same process
        - same numbers may come from different processes
        - rolling dies and flipping coins
        - when you throw a die and get a seven
    1. Patterns of non-random variation in time series data and their interpretation
        - freaks
        - shifts
        - trends
        - waves
        - sawtooths(teeth?) and other repeated patterns
1. Introducing SPC Charts
    1. Anatomy and physiology of SPC charts
    1. Testing for Non-random Variation in SPC Charts
        - Tests based on sigma limits
          - the 3-sigma test
          - the Western Electric rules
        - Runs analysis -- tests based on the distribution of data points around the centre line
          - unusually long runs
          - unusually few crossings
          - look mom, no control limits! -- using runs analysis as stand-alone rules with run charts
    1. Introducing "The Magnificent Eight"
        - Run chart
        - I chart (aka X chart)
        - MR chart
        - X-bar chart
        - S chart
        - C chart
        - U chart
        - P chart
1. Responding to SPC Signals
    1. The voice of the customer vs the voice of the process
    1. Conciliating the two voices -- or, from RAGs to RICHes
        - RAG = Red, Amber, Green
        - RICH = Respond, Investigate, Celebrate'n Hold

PART 2: Constructing SPC Charts with R

1. Your First SPC Charts with Base R
    1. A run chart
    1. Adding control limits to produce a control chart
1. Calculating Control Limits for "The Magnificent Eight" (minus one)
    - I chart (to screen or not to screen?)
    - MR chart
    - Xbar chart (several methods for sbar)
    - S chart
    - C chart
    - U chart
    - P chart
1. Highlighting Freaks, Shifts, and Trends
1. One R Function to Rule Them All
1. SPC Charts with `ggplot2`
1. Introducing `qicharts2` -- an R Package Tailored Specifically for SPC in Healthcare
1. A Note on Rational Subgrouping and Sampling

PART 3: Case Studies and Worked Examples

1. Run chart
1. P Charts for Proportion Data
1. C and U Charts for Count and Rate Data
1. I and MR Chart for Individual Measurement Data
1. X-bar and S Charts for Multiple Measurement Data

PART 4: Advanced SPC Techniques

1. Small Multiple Plots
1. Funnel Plots for Categorical Subgroups
1. Pareto Charts for Ranking Problems
1. SPC Charts for Rare Events
    - T Charts for Time Between Events
    - G Charts for Opportunities Between Cases
    - Bernoulli CUSUM charts for binary data
1. Prime Charts for Count Data with Very Large Sample Sizes
1. Screened I chart (eliminating freak moving ranges before calculating limits)
1. Improved (normalised) I chart
1. Dual charting
1. When to Split SPC Charts
1. When to Transform Data Before Plotting
1. High Frequency/Volume Data
1. Scaling Up Charts (technical issues, tabular charts, rid)
1. CUSUM and EWMA Charts
1. Multivariate charts
1. Phase One and Phase Two Applications of SPC

PART 5: Best Practices and Tips

1. Tips for Effective SPC Implementation
    - Automating production of SPC charts
    - Engaging stakeholders
    - Continuous monitoring and improvement.
    - Problems with SPC (challenges)
1. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
    - Data issues, misinterpretation of charts
    - Overreacting to common cause variation (too many or over-sensitive runs rules, too tight control limits)
    - Automating recalculation of control limits
    - One-to-one relation between PDSA cycles and dots on the plot

PART 6: Conclusion and Final Thoughts

1. Summary of Key Points
1. The Control Charts vs Run Charts Debate
1. Emerging trends in SPC and healthcare analytics
1. Encouragement for Continuous Learning and Application
1. Final Thoughts

PART 9&frac34;: Nerd Stuff

1. Introducing R
1. Basic Statistical Concepts
    1. Data types (counts and measurements)
    1. Distributions
        - centre (mean, median)
        - spread (range, percentiles, standard deviation)
        - shape (symmetric, skewed)
1. Principles for Data Visualisation
    1. Histograms and boxplots for measurement data distributions
    1. Barplots for count data distributions
    1. Scatter plots for relations between measurement data
    1. Point-and-line plots for time series data
1. Data Preparation with R
    1. Sources of healthcare data
    1. Indicator types: measurements, counts, rates, proportions
    1. Getting data in shape for visualisation with R
1. Runs Analysis Revisited
    - The joint distribution of longest run and Number of crossings
    - Improving runs analysis using the bestbox and cutbox rules
